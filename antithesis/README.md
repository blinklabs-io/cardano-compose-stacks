# Description

A 5 pools testnet using cardano-node version 10.5.4 testing consistency between nodes running UTxO-HD with LMDB and in-memory: We run 3 nodes with in-memory DB and 2 nodes with LMDB and check they are still consistent. A single Dingo node is added to the network as a client not producing blocks.
